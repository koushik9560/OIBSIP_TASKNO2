            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician. Though he had almost no formal training in pure
                mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series,
                and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable</p>
            <p>
                During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and
                equations). Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the
                Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened
                entire new areas of work and inspired a vast amount of further research. Of his thousands of results,
                all but a dozen or two have now been proven correct. The Ramanujan Journal, a scientific journal, was
                established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan, and his
                notebooks containing summaries of his published and unpublished results have been analysed and studied
                for decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas. As late as 2012, researchers
                continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about "simple properties" and "similar outputs"
                for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected
                until nearly a century after his death. He became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal
                Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity
                College, Cambridge. Of his original letters, Hardy stated that a single look was enough to show they
                could have been written only by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan to
                mathematical geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.

            <p>----Ramanujan explained that 1729 is the only number that is the sum of cubes of two different pairs of
                numbers: 12^3 + 1^3, and 10^3 + 9^3.</p>
